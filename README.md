# KernelMon
KernelMon is a virtualization-based driver monitoring infrastructure that draws inspiration from the Sysinternals suite and in particular, ProcMon.  

It basically hooks prominent KernelMode API's (for now Zw's) and transfers this inforamtion in the form of logs to a usermode UI.
KernelMon traces registry and fs reads and writes, process and thread operations.
